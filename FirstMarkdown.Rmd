# R Markdown 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
a <- 1:10
```

# Output Options {.tabset}
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

## Including Data and DataFrames

```{r, echo=TRUE}
print(a)
iris
cars
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
